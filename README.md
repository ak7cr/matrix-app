# Getting Started with Create React App

## Requirements for this short project was:

### 1. Create a 3x3 matrix
### 2. When you click on a box - color should change to green
### 3. When you click on the last box, all colors should change to orange in sequence of their clicks (original clicks)

This project was a test or sample for the main internship program suggested by Kohinoor

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
